<p>This is a demonstration of prototype 4 of the ‘financialDataAnalysis’
project.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>There were quite a few changes made in this prototype. First of all,
the website is now hosted online, meaning that you no longer have to
download the package to use it: <a href="https://ashbythorpe.shinyapps.io/financialDataAnalysis/" class="external-link uri">https://ashbythorpe.shinyapps.io/financialDataAnalysis/</a></p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="stock-data">Stock data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stock-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>Some work was done to make the default stock data easier to use. A
few unnecessary or non-useful columns were removed, and the columns were
renamed to make it easier to understand what each one represents. The
names of all the columns are now in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case" class="external-link">snake case</a></p>

AES is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and is one of the world's leading power companies, generating and distributing electric power in 15 countries and employing 10,500 people worldwide. The company was founded on January 28, 1981, as Applied Energy Services by Roger Sant and Dennis Bakke, two appointees of the Federal Energy Administration under president Richard Nixon. The company was initially a consulting firm; it became AES Corporation, which went public in 1991. Sant was chairman, CEO, and president and Bakke was executive vice president until assuming the position of president in 1987. Bakke would later become the company's CEO in 1994, serving for 8 years until his resignation in 2002, in the midst of a liquidity crisis that followed the collapse of the energy giant Enron. Sant remained as executive chairman until 2003 and as a member of the board until 2006. Paul Hanrahan was appointed President and CEO and served for 10 years, overseeing the stabilization of the company. Until the early 2000’s the company followed self management delegating much responsibility to ordinary employees. In 2012, Hanrahan resigned, his position as President and CEO of the company succeeded by Andres Gluski. As CEO, Gluski has implemented a strategy of reducing the number of countries in which AES does business, from 28 to 16, for the purpose of consolidating operations and reducing costs. Additionally, he also began a program of reducing the company's total carbon emission intensity.</span></span>

Since its founding in 2003, Tesla has broken new barriers in developing high-performance automobiles that are not only the world’s best and highest-selling pure electric vehicles—with long range and absolutely no tailpipe emissions—but also the safest, highest-rated cars on the road in the world. Beyond the flagship Model S sedan and the falcon-winged door Model X sports utility vehicle, Tesla also offers a smaller, simpler and more affordable mid-sized sedan, Model 3, which it is expected will truly propel electric vehicles into the mainstream.\r \r In addition, with the opening of the Gigafactory and the acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla now offers a full suite of energy products that incorporates solar, storage, and grid services. As the world’s only fully integrated sustainable energy company, Tesla is at the vanguard of the world’s inevitable shift towards a sustainable energy platform.</span></span>

<h2 id="price-predictions">Price predictions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#price-predictions"></a>
</h2>
<p>Previously, the price prediction process did not give great results.
A lot of time has been spent ensuring that the predictions are now very
accurate. The <code><a href="../reference/predict_price.html">predict_price()</a></code> function can be used as
before.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-input">Data input<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-input"></a>
</h2>
<p>The file input feature now accepts a much larger range of file
types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rectangular files - CSV, TSV and FWF.</li>
<li>Excel files - XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLTX and XLTM.</li>
<li>Stata files - DTA.</li>
<li>SPSS files - SAV, ZSAV and POR.</li>
<li>SAS files - SAS7BDAT, SAS7BCAT and XPT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compressed files - GX, BZ2, XZ and ZIP - can also be read. However,
they must make their uncompressed format clear through the file name
(e.g. myfile.csv.zip).</p>
<p>The data input section of the website also provides a short text
summary of the current data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="stock-summary">Stock summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stock-summary"></a>
</h2>
<p>The summary of the selected stock in the predict price section has
been drastically improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="plots">Plots<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#plots"></a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of work has been done to improve the plot section.</p>
<p>First of all, a new default plot has been created: a correlation
heatmap:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/correlation_plot.html">correlation_plot</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">mtcars</span>, show_text <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="prototype4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="700"></p>
<p>Secondly, the custom plot feature has been made much more useful.
There are now 6 different types of plots that you can create, and each
one has a much larger number of arguments to customise the plot than
before.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="settings">Settings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#settings"></a>
</h2>
<p>A settings menu was added. Admittedly, this only has one changeable
setting, which allows the user to switch from interactive plots to
static ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="minor-changes">Minor changes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#minor-changes"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are also a few minor changes that, while not super noticeable
at first, I believe will benefit the overall user experience.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of the website’s look and feel were modified
slightly.</p>
<p>Changes were made to improve the performance and speed of the
website.</p>
<p>Tooltips were added to give information about important and/or
complicated inputs.</p>
<p>Loading bars and spinners were added to all graphs.</p>
